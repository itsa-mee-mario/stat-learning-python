# Plain English Introduction to Statistical Learning

This repo acts as a supplemental plain english explanation for the [Introduction of Statistical Learning](www.StatLearning.com) (ISLR) book by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani. It includes the important concepts, equations, code, labs and homework solutions from the original book and can be used to supplement Stanford's statistical learning course.  The orignal book was written with applications in R, but guide has a focus of providing examples, labs and homework solution done in ***Python*** in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

This repo is intended for anyone who is interested in using modern statistical methods for modeling and prediction from data. This group includes scientists, engineers, data analysts, and quants, but also less technical individuals with degrees in non-quantitative fields such as the social sciences, business or management.

Similar to the ISLR book, it is expected that the reader will have had at least one elementary course in statistics and computer programming.  Basic familarity with Python, calculus, linear algebra will also be helpful but not mandatory.  We hope everyone can get something from this document!


Why read this guide and learn statistical learning?  What about the buzz words?  What about learning data mining, business analytics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science, deep learning?  Heck, machines are "learning to learn" on their own so why even learn this?

These notebooks and the original book helps set the foundation to learn all of all of those hot buzzwords, as statistics and probability along with linear algebra, calculus, and computer science are the basis for the next hot data related thing.  The book provides a foundation on the applied statistics side.  The goal for many of you might be to set the foundation for becoming a data scientist.  Now, what is a data scientist you say?  Media will tell you that being a data scientist is one of the hottest jobs in the 21st century, but what is it actually?

Data Science is the art of turning data into actions or going about taking information from diverse data sources to inform decisions and products.  It encompasses more than just statistical learning: data collection and cleaning, visualization, recommendation, optimization, simulation, and systems modeling.  The first step on this journey is an introduction to statistical learning.
